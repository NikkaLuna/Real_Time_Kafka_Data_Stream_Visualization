# Real-Time Kafka Data Stream Visualization

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time data streaming and visualization pipeline using Apache Kafka and Python. The system monitors the CPU usage on a local machine and streams the data to a Kafka topic. The data is then consumed and visualized in real-time using Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebooks. This setup is useful for monitoring system performance or learning how to handle real-time data streaming and visualization.

## Files in the Project

### 1. **Producer.py**

- **Function:** This script continuously monitors the CPU usage of the system and sends this data to a Kafka topic named `'test-topic'`. The data is sent as a byte-encoded integer representing the CPU usage percentage. The script generates and sends data every 0.5 seconds.
- **Usage:**
    - To run this script, simply execute it using Python:
    
    ```bash
    python Producer.py
    ```

    - Ensure Kafka is running and the topic `'test-topic'` is created.

### 2. **Kafka_RealTime_Plot.ipynb**

- **Function:** This Jupyter Notebook consumes CPU usage data from the Kafka topic `'test-topic'`, processes it, and appends it to a list. The data is then visualized in real-time using Matplotlib. The plot updates every second to show the latest data, displaying up to 200 data points at a time.
- **Usage:**
    - Open the notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells sequentially.
    - Ensure Kafka is running and data is being produced to the `'test-topic'` topic.

### 3. **Project.ipynb**

- **Function:** Similar to `Kafka_RealTime_Plot.ipynb`, this notebook also consumes and visualizes CPU usage data in real-time. It shows a continuously updating graph of CPU usage percentages.
- **Usage:**
    - Open the notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells sequentially.
    - Ensure Kafka is running and data is being produced to the `'test-topic'` topic.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Install Kafka:**

    - Download and install Apache Kafka from [Kafka's official site](https://kafka.apache.org/).
    - Start the Kafka server on your local machine:

    ```bash
    bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
    bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
    ```

2. **Create a Kafka Topic:**

    - Create the topic `'test-topic'`:

    ```bash
    bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
    ```

3. **Install Required Python Packages:**

    - Use `pip` to install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install kafka-python psutil matplotlib
    ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the Producer:**

    - Start the `Producer.py` script to begin sending CPU usage data to Kafka:

    ```bash
    python Producer.py
    ```

2. **Run the Consumer and Visualization:**

    - Open either `Kafka_RealTime_Plot.ipynb` or `Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
    - Run the cells to start consuming and visualizing the data in real-time.
